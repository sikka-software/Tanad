If you need to make changes to the db, check [schema.ts](mdc:src/db/schema.ts) first.
if the changes you want to make to the db involve [schema.ts](mdc:src/db/schema.ts) then make the changes to that file and after that run the command `pnpm db:generate` and then if you need to make other changes that don't involve the schema.ts, then run `supabase migration new FILE_NAME` and add the changes to that sql 

- if you want to know what's currently in the db, run use the execute_sql mcp tool with project_id: vcbrjspzfsvzgtjndjat
- Anytime you want to understand our db schema refer to [schema.ts](mdc:src/db/schema.ts)
- Anytime you want to make changes to the db run `supabase migration new FILE_NAME`
- And to apply the migrations run `supabase db push --include-all`
